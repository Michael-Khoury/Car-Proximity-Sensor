# Car UI and Proximity Sensor ðŸš—

A Python-based project that mimics modern car dashboard features with a built-in proximity sensor system. Designed to enhance driver safety by integrating real-time sensor data visualization using Arduino.

---

## ðŸ“‹ Features
- **Modern Car Dashboard UI**: Displays simulated car metrics in a user-friendly interface.
- **Proximity Sensor Integration**: Alerts users when objects are detected nearby.
- **Real-Time Data Visualization**: Displays sensor readings dynamically.

---

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- **Python**: For developing the user interface and handling data processing.
- **Arduino**: For hardware integration and proximity sensor setup.
- - **Analog Sensors**: Used to detect proximity and provide real-time input to the Arduino for further processing and visualization in the Python interface.
